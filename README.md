---

# Model Training and Evaluation

## Model Used
In this experiment, I utilized the ResNet-18 model for image classification tasks with ColossalAI.

## Dataset Employed
I employed the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Instructions on How to Run the Code
1. **Set up your environment**: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Run the ResNet_CIFAR_ColossalAI.ipynb. It will download the dataset automatically. The training process and evaluation are both in the Notebook.

## Experiment Results
Results are summarized in the table below:

| Model | Training Loss | Test Accuracy (%) |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| ResNet-18     | 0.0775         | 84.53             |
